Simulation of the Three-body problem using JavaScript
<p>
This is a simple program that uses Newton's laws for simulating the trajectories of a given number of bodies interacting gravitationally. Uses the p5.js JavaScript library. It is quite fun to watch the ensuing chaos; if the masses don't get ejected off their orbits that is.
